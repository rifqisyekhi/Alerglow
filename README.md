The skin allergy detection application aims to solve the problem of difficulty in identifying skin allergy symptoms using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm. The application is built with JavaScript for the frontend and Python for the backend. Users can upload photos of their skin, which are then analyzed by the CNN model to detect signs of skin allergies. The analysis results are returned to the frontend and presented through a responsive and user-friendly interface. Based on the detection, the application provides initial care suggestions or recommends consulting a dermatologist, helping users take prompt and appropriate actions.
